# Analyze-A-B-Test-Results

# Overview

A/B tests are very commonly performed by data analysts and data scientists.For this project, you will be working to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. The company has developed a new web page in order to try and increase the number of users who "convert," meaning the number of users who decide to pay for the company's product. The goal is to use the datasets to help companies figure out whether they should use the new page or keep the old page, or extend the test time before makeing decision.

This project will includes three parts, Probability calculations, A/B Test running, and Regression analysis.
